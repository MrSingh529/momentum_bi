## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust, reliability, and a professional atmosphere.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E8EAF6), nearly desaturated, for a clean, executive feel that allows data to stand out.
- Accent color: A subdued violet (#7E57C2) to complement the primary, drawing focus to interactive elements without overwhelming the UI.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to provide a modern, machined, objective, neutral look appropriate for the app's content.
- Use crisp, modern icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design icons). Icons should be simple and represent their function clearly.
- Card-based layout for KPI summaries with a clear visual hierarchy. Visualizations in the middle section, and detailed tables below. Responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and data updates to enhance user experience without being distracting.
